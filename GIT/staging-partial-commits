Staging partial commits

Lets you stage only parts of the changes made to a file for
committing, instead of the entire contents.

	Git add --patch FILE
	Responses:

	y   yes; stage this change
	n   no; don't stage this change
	s   split; cut the change in smaller parts
	e   edit; manually define the part to split
