gpg: Quick and dirty

`gpg` is a powerful encryption tool and can do many useful things, but
sometimes you just need a simple tool to encrypt and decrypt data
for yourself.

Start with the following alias (in .zshrc or .bashrc, depending on your shell -
change to gpg2 if you use gpg2):

    alias gpg='gpg --default-recipient-self'
This alias makes the default recipient be *you*, so if you don't specify one,
it will be encrypted for you.

Then to encrypt a file:

    gpg -e FILE

And to decrypt it:

    gpg -d FILE.gpg -o FILE
