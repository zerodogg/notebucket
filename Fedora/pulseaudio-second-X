Using pulseaudio on a second X server (on Fedora 18)

If you want to run a secondary X server (ie. for gaming), you may run into
audio troubles. There are several ways to fix it, the one I'm presenting here
is the "easy, but hacky" version. It may have side-effects, and you will likely
need to reverse it if you want support from the Fedora community.

First, add your user into the "`audio`" group. This will let your user write
directly to your audio device.

Second, add `pax11publish -r` to the top of the startup script for your
secondary X server.  This will ensure you get a fresh pulseaudio server.
