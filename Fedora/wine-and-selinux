Using wine on Fedora with SELinux enabled

SELinux might become very unhappy if you try to run wine, but there's no reason
to disable SELinux. You just need to tweak some SELinux booleans.

First, the one you most likely want is to set the `wine_mmap_zero_ignore`

    sudo setsebool -P wine_mmap_zero_ignore 1

See `man wine_selinux` for more information about `wine_mmap_zero_ignore`.

Second another one you may encounter, which is more invasive is `mmap_low_allowed`,
see [this bugreport on the Fedora bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=527147)
for a discussion on the issue, and [this wiki article on winehq](http://wiki.winehq.org/PreloaderPageZeroProblem)
for information about it from wine's perspective. To enable it, run:

    sudo setsebool -P mmap_low_allowed 1
