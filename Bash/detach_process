Detach a process from its terminal in bash

Bash has very powerful job control with its `Ctrl-Z`, `fg` and `bg`
commands. A lesser known (but equally powerful) feature is `disown`. `disown`
will detach a process from its controlling terminal, allowing it to continue
running after you have exited your terminal.
