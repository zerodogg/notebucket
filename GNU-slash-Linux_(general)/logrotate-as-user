Logrotate as a user

Logrotate can be used as a user by supplying the `--state` (`-s`) parameter,
which specifies an alternate location for the logrotate state file. Ie.
`logrotate --state ~/.logrotate.state ~/.logrotate.conf` where
~/.logrotate.conf is your custom logrotate config file (which uses the same
syntax as /etc/logrotate.conf).
