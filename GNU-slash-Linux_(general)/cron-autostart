Automatically run a command on boot as a user

`cron` has an `@reboot` "time" that you can use, which makes the command run
once during boot. This is very handy for running commands after a reboot as a
user (in particular if you don't have root access and thus can't edit
/etc/rc.local). Example (in your crontab - `crontab -e`):

	@reboot /home/myuser/initCommand
