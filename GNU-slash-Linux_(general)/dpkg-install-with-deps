Install a local .deb package (and resolve dependencies)

`apt-get` and `aptitude` can't install local packages, and installation with
`dpkg -i` will not install any additional dependencies (requiring an additional
`apt-get install -f` afterwards to resolve the deps).

The `gdebi` tool can install a local .deb package and resolve, download and
install any dependencies (and in case you're wondering, gdebi is not a
graphical tool, that's gdebi-gtk, gdebi's gtk front-end).
